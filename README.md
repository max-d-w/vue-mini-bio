# vue-mini-bio
Create a SPA (single page application) about yourself with at least three components that are navigated using buttons. Styling is not required as long as the page is legible.

## Important Points
- Vue Component Structure
- Vue Component Properties
- HTML
- V Directives (particularly v-if)
- Template Interpolation ({{ var }})
- Manipulating Data

Don't overlook HTML. It's very simple, but a good understanding of it is important and is easily misused.
